    <string name="instructionsfull">Rules of Ghost \n Players form a word by alternating turns saying a letter, which is added
        on to the end of the word fragment. There are two ways to lose Ghost: \n
        1. Forming a word longer than 3 letters (“PEA” is ok, but “PEAR” is not). \n
        2. Creating a fragment (of any size) which cannot become a word by adding more
        letters (for example, “QZ”). \n \n
        Winning Ghost is simply not losing! So, for example, game play proceeds like this: \n
        - Player 1 says a letter. For example, ‘P’. \n
        - Player 2 says a letter. For example, ‘E’. \n
        - Player 1 says a letter. For example, ‘A’. Player 1 has formed the word PEA, but that’s okay because it is not longer than 3 letters. \n
        - Player 2 says a letter. For example, ‘F’. \n
        - Player 1 says a letter. Player 1 must say ‘O’, because only one word starts with PEAF. If Player 1 says any other letter, for example ‘A’, he or she loses, because no word begins with PEAFA.
        - Player 2 says a letter, which must be ‘W’. \n
        - Player 1 says a letter, which must be ‘L’. Player 1 loses, because PEAFOWL is a word. \n \n
        The amount of points you receive is based on how many letter you were able to guess before game over.</string>
