### Summary of the project
Ghost is a wordgame that is played by two players. The players form a word by alternating turns saying a letter, which is added on the end of the word fragment. A player loses when he/she forms a word longer than 3 letters or creates a fragment which cannot become a word by adding more letters.
   
*(Ghost will be a native app for Android. Min. SDK: API 19, Android 4.4 (KitKat))*
